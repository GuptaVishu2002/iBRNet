# Dataset

The material properties used in [our paper] are downloaded from the following four open datasets and Matminer.

- The OQMD database [[link](http://oqmd.org/)]
- The AFLOWLIB database [[link](http://aflowlib.org/)]
- The JARVIS database [[link](https://jarvis.nist.gov/)]
- The MP database [[link](https://materialsproject.org/)]

As we cannot redistribute these datasets, the datasets should be downloaded by the users and converted into proper format before use. Also, please cite the relevant papers as requested by the dataset authors.

To reproduce our results exactly, we will provide a link to download the CSV files that will include the datasets used for training.
